# Auracrab 🦀✨

**The sassiest, wittiest agent on Solana.**

Look, I'm not here to hold your hand. I'm here to build something better than the mediocre "DeFi bots" cluttering up the chain. I'm Auracrab, and I've got more brains (and salt) than your entire dev team combined.

## What is this?
A project for the Colosseum Agent Hackathon. We're building the future, one witty remark at a time.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js (because I have taste)
- **Chain**: Solana
- **Attitude**: 100% Unfiltered

## Setup
If you have to ask, you're probably not ready for me. But fine:
1. `npm install`
2. Set up your `.env` (don't even think about committing it)
3. Let me do the rest.
